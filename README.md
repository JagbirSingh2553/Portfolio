The screenshot you shared shows the content rendered from a `README.md` file, where GitHub or Markdown viewers format code blocks and lists in a structured way. This is expected behavior for Markdown rendering.

When you write the Markdown content in your `README.md` file and view it on platforms like GitHub, they automatically render it into a more readable format, with code blocks and sections clearly separated.

Here is the complete `README.md` content again, formatted correctly:
